CC: Tweaked is a mod for Minecraft which adds programmable computers, turtles and more to the game. An add-on to the
much-beloved [ComputerCraft], it continues its legacy with improved performance and stability, along with a wealth of
new features.

CC: Tweaked can be installed from [Modrinth]. It requires [Minecraft Forge] and [ComputerCraft 1.50] and MUST be
installed as a core mod.

## Contributing
Any contribution is welcome, be that using the mod, reporting bugs or contributing code. If you want to get started
developing the mod, [check out the instructions here](CONTRIBUTING.md#developing).

## Community
If you need help getting started with CC: Tweaked, want to show off your latest project, or just want to chat about
ComputerCraft, do check out our [forum] and [GitHub discussions page][GitHub discussions]! There's also a fairly
populated, albeit quiet [IRC channel][irc], if that's more your cup of tea.

We also host fairly comprehensive documentation at [tweaked.cc](https://tweaked.cc/ "The CC: Tweaked website").
